## Run Pulsar locally

Download docker
``` 
docker run -it -p <local-server-port>:<remote-server-port>  -p <local-admin-port>:<remote-admin-port> --mount source=pulsardata,target=/pulsar/data --mount source=pulsarconf,target=/pulsar/conf apachepulsar/pulsar:<version> bin/pulsar standalone

```

## Produce and Consume Simple Message
Run client to subscribe and start listening. 
``` 
$ python client.py
```
You should see logs like 
``` 
2024-03-25 13:19:09.614 INFO  [0x1f5275e00] Client:86 | Subscribing on Topic :my-topic

```
Then open another terminal and send some test messages using server.py. 
This script will just run and exit. 
``` 
python server.py
```
Then go back to the client.py terminal and you should see that the client has 
received messages
``` 
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-0''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-1''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-2''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-3''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-4''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-5''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-6''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-7''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-8''
Received message: 'b'hello-pulsar-9''
...
```
To print the stats for a topic, one can use pulsar's admin api. To test it out, 
open another terminal and run 
``` 
python stats.py
```
And you should see stats in json format, printed every 5 seconds until the server.py process is killed:
``` 
{'msgRateIn': 0.0, 'msgThroughputIn': 0.0, 'msgRateOut': 0.0, 'msgThroughputOut': 0.0, 'bytesInCounter': 490, 'msgInCounter': 10, 'bytesOutCounter': 490, 'msgOutCounter': 10, 'averageMsgSize': 0.0, 'msgChunkPublished': False, 'storageSize': 490, 'backlogSize': 0, 
'publishRateLimitedTimes': 0, 'earliestMsgPublishTimeInBacklo...
```

## Produce and Consume Json Message
Let's test sending json message like this 
``` 
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

Produce a message in json format
``` 
$ python json_producer.py
```
Then consume it (will exist after consuming):
``` 
$ python json_consumer.py
```
